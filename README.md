# Overview
The goal of this project was to create three different charts off of a data file containing test subjects reporting on the frequency they wash their belly buttons and the types of bacteria found in their belly buttons. 

# Deliverable 1 

I created a horizontal bar chart that displays the top 10 bacterial cultures found per the chosen test subject in the drop down menu.

# Deliverable 2

I created a bubble chart displaying the size of each bubble in proportionate to the number of bacteria the sample contains per the chosen test subject in the drop down menu.  

# Deliverable 3

I created a gauge chart displaying the washing frequency of each test subject's belly button with ranges in the gauge in increments of two per the chosen test subject in the drop down menu.

# Deliverable 4

I added an image to the jumbotron and a background color for the webpage.  I added custom fonts and colors per chart.  I added more information on each chart below the chart.  The webpage is mobile-responsive.

# Results

I added the additional filters of city, state, country and shape.  I was able to successfully search on each filter and combined filters.
